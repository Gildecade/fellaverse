# Projectï¼š Fellaverse
## 1. Problem Description
A group of fellas from the ECE department of University of Waterloo want to find a way to practice their programming skills. In our spare time, we often go to the gym four times a week with different training targets, and sometime, we forget the weight that we set before for a specific equipment. Also, to make the training more effective, there is a need to make the numbers competitive and let the other fellas know about it. So, Fellaverse comes to play here, which is a cross-platform application that allows a user to track his/her fitness record and notify other fellas. The detail description of Fellaverse is discussed in section 2 of this document. 

The main features of the Fellaverse include:
- the ability to create/read/update/delete fitness schedule
- the ability to create/read/update/delete fitness record
- the ability to set a time off if in vacation or sickness
- the ability to communicate with other users using gif and emoji
- the ability to view/upload/delete training video as a coach
- the ability to manage system preferences 

Optionals:
- the ability to analyze fitness data like heart rate using ML or DL
- the ability to notify user by sending email or showing notification in the mobile app
- the ability to analyze article by NLP 

## 2. Features
Fellaverse supports three categories of users: trainees, coaches and system administrators.

Trainee can create new fitness schedule in a weekly basis, and modify/delete it if needed. For example, trainee can create a schedule targeting back muscles in the next 10 weeks on Thursday. In this 

coach can do anything that trainee can do, and also view/upload/delete training video. 

System administrator can manage all the user related operations and also can be acted as a coach to monitor all the trainees and upload training videos to the system. 

which is meant to create an interactive fun community for all the fellas. As the first step, a gym community will be implemented for everyone who wants to learn how to work out and mark their fitness records.  

The ultimate goal of Fellaverse is to build an interactive fun community for all the fellas. We might potentially add a community related to Japanese anime. 

## 3. Technical Specification
The backend should use JAVA with the Spring framework. The frontend should use React. All source code should follow standard UNIX programming conventions and using advanced OO programming techniques such as polymorphism and design patterns. 

### 3.1 User Interface (UI)
Fellaverse user interface will preferably be both in web page and in IOS app. Both of them should have the same functionalities and share the same database storage. In general, user features should be easily nevigable, either as menu items and/or pop-up menus. The look-and-feel of the system should be professional and consistent with commercially available UIs.

### 3.2 Data Storage
Fellaverse will have a central database which contains all the user information. 

### 3.3 Delivery and Deployment
Fellaverse should have 3 

Fellaverse should be delivered in a straightforward automatic pipeline.
