## Project Abstract
A group of fellas from the ECE department of University of Waterloo want to find a way to practice their programming skills. In our spare time, we often go to the gym four times a week with different training targets, and sometime, we forget the weight that we set before for a specific equipment. Also, to make the training more effective, there is a need to make the numbers competitive and let the other fellas know about it. So, Fellaverse comes to play here, which is a single web application that allows a user to track his/her fitness record and notify other fellas. Some main features will include but not limit to are 
- the ability to create/read/update/delete fitness schedule
- the ability to create/read/update/delete fitness record
- the ability to set a time off if in vacation or sickness
- the ability to perform deep analysis with the fitness data by using the weight changes, heart rate or time, and also show the result by some graphs such as line or bar graph
- the ability to communicate with other users using gif and emoji
- the ability to manage system preferences 
- the ability to view/purchase virtual fitness classes 


As for the technology that would be used within the project, the backend should use JAVA with the [Spring](https://spring.io/quickstart) framework, and the frontend should use [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). The target UI component library is [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/). We will follow the [agile](https://asana.com/resources/agile-methodology?utm_campaign=NB--NAMER--EN--Catch-All--All-Device--DSA&utm_source=google&utm_medium=pd_cpc_nb&gclid=CjwKCAjwzY2bBhB6EiwAPpUpZm-EEHhhibr3UUiEFmIjURx6f9L_AAyBwr2TjHagW0p71OylaFbJtxoCTVcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) software developing management system, and use git for version controlling. In particular, we might use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=103971651024&campaign=9521086470&creative=536313571844&device=c&keyword=agile&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p52018173426&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001558501&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=CjwKCAjwzY2bBhB6EiwAPpUpZmGPwEe3TB9Zxq0FKUb4d3_s4n_rhpfCMiR30g30tfUlJbFUaExsIhoCpz8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) or [Azure devops](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/) to manage the project. The target database system is MySQL, and we will use [Hibernate](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/quickstart/html_single/#_maven_repository_artifacts) as an ORM to manage all the created entities from the backend system. All source code should follow standard UNIX programming conventions and using advanced OO programming techniques such as polymorphism and design patterns. [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is prefered here in terms of IDE.

In Summary, we hope to build an enjoyable fitness community for everyone who loves to go to the gym.
